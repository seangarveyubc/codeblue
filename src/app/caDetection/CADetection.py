    - Signal
        - Is sending data every 0.02s, or 50HZ
        - For a regular heart beat signal, one can expect that there is between 1 and 3 peaks/second
            - Any more, or any less could/should signal that the user is either
                - Not in a healthy range
                - Not wearing their sensor properly
            - Based on healthy cardiac signals from test data (1Hz, 60BPM)
                - @ T = 0.00s -> Peak
                - @ T = 0.15s -> Trough
                - @ T = 1.00s -> Peak
            - Based on healthy cardiac signals from test data (2Hz, 120BPM)
                - @ T = 0.00s -> Peak
                - @ T = 0.08s -> Trough
                - @ T = 0.50s -> Peak
            - Based on healthy cardiac signals from test data (3Hz, 180BPM)
                - @ T = 0.00s -> Peak
                - @ T = 0.08s -> Trough
                - @ T = 0.33s -> Peak

    - Algorithm
        - The algorithm will listen for the first two data points before starting to analyze for detection
            - Based on the test data, this will account for 0.06s of "unanalyzed" data
        - The algorithm will monitor signals in two fashions
            - Peak detection & monitoring
                - Peak height
                    - In relation to the average signal height
                    - In relation to the average trough depth
                - Peak-to-peak distance
                    - In relation to previous peaks
                - Absolute peak height
                    - In relation to a signal value of 0
            - Fourier transform
                - Discrete, non-uniform
                - Used to ensure that the signal frequencey is within a health range
                    - Between 1 & 3 Hz (60-180 BPM)
            - Based on othe nature of the signal, the smallest window that we can use is 3 data points to determine a peak (0.06s)
                - Since the distance between a peak and a trough can be 0.08s
